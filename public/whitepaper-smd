### Commission Structure

#### Tier 1: Direct Referrals

| Referral Level | SOL Commission | $SMD Bonus | Requirements |

### Example Earnings

#### Scenario 1: Single Large Client
```
Client purchases: 100 blocks in Gold Zone
Cost: 100 SOL
Your commission (Silver tier): 10 SOL + 5 $SMD tokens
USD Value (@ SOL=$100): $1,000 + $50 = $1,050
```

#### Scenario 2: Multiple Small Clients
```
10 clients @ 10 blocks each (Bronze Zone)
Total: 100 blocks × 0.1 SOL = 10 SOL
Your commission (Bronze tier): 0.8 SOL + 0.4 $SMD
Monthly recurring (10 clients/month): $80 + $4 = $84/month
```

#### Scenario 3: Platinum Referrer
```
100 referrals/month averaging 20 blocks each
Average purchase: 2 SOL per referral
Total volume: 200 SOL/month
Your commission (Platinum): 30 SOL + 15 $SMD
Monthly income: $3,000 + $150 = $3,150/month
